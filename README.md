# CafeApp
A Cafe(Coffee shop)App using flutter

This app is the UI of a Coffee Shop app I have in mind:
You can choose any item from the Cafe's Menu and select ant item as much as you want.
After each time selecting an item a pop up will apear which will notify you that thhe item has been added to your cart.
Whenever you selected all of the itemes you wanted  you can head to the Cart Screen and check your orders list.
You can select the Pay Button and then you can choose from the Payment methods.



TO ADD THINGS :
I am working to make the full app; So I'm gonna add some more features to this app such as:

Tables Screen:
"You can choose which table you are sitting at, before starting to order"

Connecting the app to the firebase:
"To Store User's Cart lists Data bases to the server so we can use those datas and send them to the Kitchen app"

Admin (or Kitchen) App:
"Which would get the realtime data from the firebase and whould show and display the user's cart from each table to the staff of the kitchen
so they can deliver the orders asap"

Payment methods:
"It would depend on the Cafe which is going to use this app and the different ways they have for the user payments"

Menu:
"Again in depends on the Cafe and how they like the Menu Screen's UI but we can change it as they like or just add items from their menu
to the current menu"
